	//The actual target row in a TableKind.TypeDef table is given by the combination of TypeDefId
	//(in effect, row number) and Implementation (in effect, the module that holds the target TableKind.TypeDef table).

	//b. Originally defined in this Assembly but now moved to another Assembly.
	//Flags must have TypeAttributes.IsTypeForwarder set
	//and Implementation is an TableKind.AssemblyRef
	//indicating the Assembly the type may now be found in.
	//The full name of the type need not be stored directly.
	//Instead, it can be split into two parts at any included '.'
	//(although typically this is done at the last '.' in the full name).

	//and that following the '.' is stored as the TypeName.
	//If there is no '.' in the full name,
	//then the TypeNamespace shall be the index of the empty string.
